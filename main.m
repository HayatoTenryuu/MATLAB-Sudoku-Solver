%% App to Solve Sudoku Puzzles

Summary:

This is a MATLAB version of the same project in C# and Qt/C++.
And to be honest, MATLAB apps have such limited doability, I 
really prefer the others compared to this one. I can't control
any of the good parts of this app...

run app1_export;     % I have all the setup and such within the other file, so this is enough.
